# Outside Projects Used
---
## Description
---
Often times, a project will make use of other open source projects to add a certain functionality to the given project. In order to give a more complete and comprehensive picture of the given project, there will be links to outside projects which were used along with abbreviated list of metrics for those outside projects, including the size, first commit, most recent commit, total commits, and number of contributors.

## Objectives
---
- Give a reviewer a more complete view of the given project by understanding the references it has to other open source projects

## Implementation
---
- Add an additional metric which is `Outside Projects Used` and provide a link to those projects as well as CHAOSS metrics given that they have them
